\section{RoboBrain Knowledge Engine}
RoboBrain knowledge engine \cite{}, aims to develop a semantic network that stores concepts such as grasping features, affordance properties, semantic labels, lexical entries etc. which are useful for different applications in Robotics. 

In this report, we provide an update on recent results in successful usage of RoboBrain for well known robotic task of natural language grounding \cite{} and grasping objects \cite{}.
